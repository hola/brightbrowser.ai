Changing Location feature enables you to dynamically adjust your proxy’s geographic location within a specified region. It’s perfect for geo-targeted data collection, regional content testing, and simulating user behavior from various locations. This ensures accurate scraping, localization testing, and access to location-restricted content across different geographic regions.

In the **Headless Browser** tab, update the 2-letter country code in the command by replacing `country-us` with your desired country.
