The browser.ai Playground is your interactive code editor for experimenting with Scraping Browser. Run pre-built example scripts or tweak them to test your own automation workflows.

While Scraping Browser supports multiple languages and libraries, the Playground currently runs Puppeteer with JavaScript — but don’t worry, more support is on the way!

Please note that some features requiring user-side infrastructure, like saving files locally or using pre-installed libraries (e.g., Cheerio), won’t work in the Playground. For full functionality, run Scraping Browser in your own development environment.

### Playground Features
- Code editor:
    - By default, the code editor loads a pre-configured example scraper script.
    - You can freely edit, modify, or completely replace example scripts to build and run your own custom scraper with Scraping Browser.
    - A reset button is available to restore the original example script.
- Console logs view.
- Web Interaction & Results View: Displays raw HTML processed by the browser or visualizes browser interactions in real time.

### Example Scripts

Execute pre-built example scripts to see **browser.ai in action instantly**. These scripts demonstrate real-site scraping, providing full script visibility, console logs, and a live browser interaction preview.

### Code Editing

Use the code editor to edit the default example scripts or replace them altogether with your own and run any custom scripts to view results or debug your code.
If needed you can always click the reset button and **revert back to the original** example script.
