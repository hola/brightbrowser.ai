The BrightBrowser.ai Playground is your interactive code editor for experimenting with Scraping Browser. Run pre-built example scripts or tweak them to test your own automation workflows.

While Scraping Browser supports multiple languages and libraries, the Playground currently runs Puppeteer with JavaScript — but don’t worry, more support is on the way!

Please note that some features requiring user-side infrastructure, like saving files locally or using pre-installed libraries (e.g., Cheerio), won’t work in the Playground. For full functionality, run Scraping Browser in your own development environment.

### Playground Features
- Code editor:
    - By default the code editor will be hosting an example scraper script
    - Script examples can be edited freely or including completely removing them and building any custom script from scratch to run with the Scraping Browser
    - A reset button to revert back to the original example script
- Console logs view
- Web interaction and results view: presents the raw HTML going through the browser or visualizes the browser interactions.

### Ready Made Example
Run existing example scripts to instantly see the product at work. The example scripts demo the scraping of real target sites. You will be able to see the full script, console logs and a visualization of the browser interaction with the target site.

### Code Editing
Use the code editor to edit the default example scripts or replace them altogether with your own and run any custom scripts to view results or debug your code.
If needed you can always click the reset button and revert back to the original example script.
