**BrightBrowser.AI** is **a purpose-built, serverless browser for high-scale web automation**, designed to eliminate the typical challenges of data extraction.

* No setup required — runs out of the box with Puppeteer, Playwright, and Selenium

* Handles unblocking automatically — proxies, headers, and CAPTCHAs are covered

* Designed for scale — adjust the number of browser sessions dynamically.

### Why Use Scraping Browser?

**Extract data from JavaScript-heavy, bot-protected sites** without extra work.

* Automate full web interactions — clicking, scrolling, form-filling, and more.

* Forget about infrastructure — we handle browser management, you focus on coding.

No bans, no roadblocks, just clean, structured data at scale.
