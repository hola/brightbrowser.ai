<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I navigate to multiple pages in one session?">
    **Nope\!** browser.ai is designed for **single-page navigation per session**.

    **What this means:**

    - You can **navigate within a page** (clicks, scrolling, interactions).
    - But **you can't load a second domain** within the same session.

    **Solution?** If you need to load multiple pages, **spawn a new session** for each URL.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How long can my session stay active?">
    - **Idle sessions** (no interaction) **auto-close after 5 minutes**.
    - **Max session duration:** 30 minutes. After that, your session will time out.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I force browser.ai to use a specific country?">
    The **Change Location** feature lets you adjust your browser.ai’s geographic location for accurate geo-targeted scraping and content testing. You can change the location by:

    1. Updating the `{"country":"XX"}` field in the **API Token** tab.
    2. Replacing `country-us` in the **Headless Browser** tab with your desired country code.

    <br />

    **Want all of Europe?**\
    Use `-country-eu` to dynamically select an EU-based IP.

    <Tip>
      **Heads-up:** For **bot-heavy** websites, manually selecting a country may actually decrease success rates. Let browser.ai handle it automatically when possible\!

  <Accordion title="How can I take a screenshot of my session?">
    Need **visual proof** of what's happening in your session? Capture a **screenshot** at any time:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Node.js">
        ```js Puppeteer

    </Tabs>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why does my page take longer to load than expected?">
    Some websites have **complex anti-bot measures**, which require extra processing to **bypass protections**.

    **To ensure smooth navigation, increase the timeout threshold:**

    <CodeGroup>

    ```js Puppeteer
    // Navigate to site with 2 min timeout  
    page.goto('<https://example.com>', { timeout: 2*60*1000 });  
    ```

    
    ```python Playwright
    #  Navigate to site with 2 min timeout   
    page.goto('<https://example.com>', timeout=2*60*1000)  
    ```

    
    ```cs PuppeteerSharp
    //  Navigate to site with 2 min timeout   
    await page.GoToAsync("https://example.com", new NavigationOptions()  
    {  
        Timeout = 2*60*1000,  
    });
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

    <Tip>
      Always set a **higher timeout (2\+ minutes)** for bot-protected websites.
    </Tip>
