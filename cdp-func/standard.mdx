BrightBrowser.ai is fully CDP-compatible , meaning every Puppeteer function and feature works right out of the box. You can explore the complete Puppeteer API in the official Puppeteer documentation . But we didn’t stop there—we’ve added exclusive BrightBrowser.ai CDP events, fine-tuned for high-performance scraping and stealth browsing. Take full control of your automation stack and push the limits of what’s possible.

The following are a few common browser navigation functions to get you started.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Get Page HTML">
    ```js NodeJS - Puppeteer
    const page = await browser.newPage();  
    await page.goto('https://example.com');  
    const html = await page.content();
    ```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Click on element">
    ```js NodeJS - Puppeteer
    // node.js puppeteer   
    const page = await page.newPage();  
    await page.goto('https://example.com');  
    await page.click('a[href]');
    ```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Scroll to page bottom">
    You might need to scroll the viewport to the bottom at times, such as when activating 'infinite scroll'. Here's how:

    ```js NodeJS - Puppeteer
    // node.js puppeteer   
    const page = await page.newPage();  
    await page.goto('https://example.com');  
    await page.evaluate(()=>window.scrollBy(0, window.innerHeight));
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Take Screenshot">
    <CodeGroup>
      ```js NodeJS - Puppeteer
      // More info at https://pptr.dev/api/puppeteer.page.screenshot  
      await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshot.png', fullPage: true });
      ```

      ```python Python - Playwright
      # More info at <https://playwright.dev/python/docs/screenshots>  
      await page.screenshot(path='screenshot.png', full_page=True)
      ```

      ```cs C# - PuppeteerSharp
      await page.ScreenshotAsync("screenshot.png", new ()  
      {  
          FullPage = true,  
      });
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    <Note>
      When running the example scripts above the screenshot above will be saved as “screenshot.png” within your files.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Set Cookies">
    Please note that this is supported onl for customers who completed the KYC verification process.

    ```js NodeJS Puppeteer
    const page = await browser.newPage();  
    await page.setCookie({name: 'LANG', value: 'en-US', domain: 'example.com'});  
    await page.goto('https://example.com');
    ```

    For more info: https://pptr.dev/api/puppeteer.page.setcookie
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Blocking Endpoints">
    It is possible to block endpoints that are not required to save bandwidth. See an example of this below:

    ```js NodeJS - Puppeteer
    // connect to a remote browser...
    const blockedUrls = ['*doubleclick.net*'];
    const page = await browser.newPage();
    const client = await page.target().createCDPSession();
    await client.send('Network.enable');
    await client.send('Network.setBlockedURLs', {urls: blockedUrls});
    await page.goto('https://washingtonpost.com');
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Country Targeting">
    When using the Scraping Browser, the same **country-targeting** parameter is available to use as in our other proxy products.

    When setting up your script, add the `-country` flag, **after** your "USER" credentials within the Bright Data endpoint, followed by the 2-letter [ISO code](https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/country_code_list.htm) for that country.

    ```js
    const SBR_WS_ENDPOINT = `wss://${USER-country-us:PASS}@brd.superproxy.io:9222`;
    ```

    In the example above, we added `-country-us` to the Bright Data endpoint within our script, so our request will originate from the United States ("us").

    #### EU region

    You can target the entire European Union region in the same manner as "Country" above by adding "eu" after "country" in your request: `-country-eu`
    Requests sent using `-country-eu`, will use IPs from **one** of the countries below which are included automatically within "eu":

    ```sh Countries
    AL, AZ, KG, BA, UZ, BI, XK, SM, DE, AT, CH, UK, GB, IE, IM, FR, ES, NL, IT, PT, BE, AD, MT, MC, MA, LU, TN, DZ, GI, LI, SE, DK, FI, NO, AX, IS, GG, JE, EU, GL, VA, FX, FO
    ```

    <Note>
      The allocation of a country within the EU is random.
