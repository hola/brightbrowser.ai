### Workflow & Requirements

To automate logging in to websites with BrowserAI, please be aware of the requirements and proper workflow, especially when handling multifactor authentication.

### Automated Login Process

BrowserAI **can automate standard login flows** in your tasks.

However, if an **OTP** (One-Time Password), such as an SMS code, is required during the login process, you must follow a two-step approach:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initiate Login Task">
    - Open the target website and navigate to the login form.
    - Enter the username and password credentials.
    - Use the [`/tasks` API endpoint](https://docs.browser.ai/api-reference/endpoint/tasks) to retrieve the corresponding `execution_id`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit OTP for Verification">
    - Once you receive the OTP (for example, via SMS), you need to provide this code to BrowserAI.
    <Warning>You have **3 minutes** to submit the OTP code as an instruction before the task is **canceled!**</Warning>
    - Submit the OTP as a new instruction for the same task by using the [`/instructions` API endpoint](https://docs.browser.ai/api-reference/endpoint/addInstructions).
    - This step allows BrowserAI to complete the authentication and proceed with your original workflow.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>Signing in to login forms using BrowserAI **requires successful completion of KYC** procedure before any activity can be performed.</Note>
