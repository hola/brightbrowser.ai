title: Deactivate Captcha Solver
sidebarTitle: Captcha Solver
description: By default, BrightBrowser.ai automatically solves CAPTCHAs as part of its proxy unblocking system, ensuring seamless requests.

Disabling the CAPTCHA solver keeps BrightBrowser.aiâ€™s unlocker algorithm active, handling proxy selection, headers, and fingerprinting while skipping automatic CAPTCHA solving. This gives your team a lightweight, flexible solution for broader scraping opportunities.

Best for:
- Scraping data without getting blocked.
- Emulating real-user behavior for stealthy automation.
- Teams without an unblocking system that want to skip automatic CAPTCHA solving.

<Accordion title="How to start?">
